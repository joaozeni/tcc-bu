abstract="Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers are currently very effective in practice. However, there are still many challenging problems for SAT solvers. Nowadays, extra computational power is no longer coming from higher processor frequencies. At the same time, multicore architectures are becoming predominant. Exploiting this new architecture is essential for the evolution of SAT solvers. Due to the increasing interest in parallel SAT solving, it is important to give an overview of what has been done so far. This paper presents an overview of parallel SAT solving and it is expected to be a valuable document for researchers in this field. This overview covers the main topics of parallel SAT solving, namely, different approaches and a variety of clause sharing strategies. Additionally, an evaluation of multicore SAT solvers is presented, showing the evolution of multicore SAT solvers over the last years.",
